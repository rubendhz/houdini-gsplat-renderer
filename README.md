# Disclaimer

**This project is a side endeavor, and the code is provided as is.** While I perform _some_ testing, it has **not** been thoroughly validated across platforms or Houdini versions. Please keep this in mind and understand that I offer no guarantees of robustness or full compatibility. Thank you for your understanding!

# Context

In November 2023, while sitting in the dentist's chair trying to escape to my happy place, it struck me: despite the surge in Gaussian Splatting rasterisers, none had made their way into Houdini's viewport (at least, none that I knew of). At that moment, it seemed criminal, though maybe that was just the anesthesia wearing off and my irritability setting in.

Jokes aside, on my way home, I decided to give it a go. I had never used Houdini's HDK so I saw this as the greatest excuse I could come up with to finally play with it. I was curious about whether it was possible to implement a decent viewport rasteriser for Gaussian Splats without having to go deeper than what the HDK allows. However, I was convinced that, if possible, Houdini was going to be a great fit as it excels at procedural manipulation of point attributes at scale, which happens to be very convenient for this technique in order to provide creative control. The only thing missing was **a way to visualise those procedural modifications live to tighten the creative loop**, which is exactly what I set out to do. Fast-forward a few weeks, and my conviction had grown to the point where I couldn’t imagine Houdini’s future without the ability to render this type of data natively.

While there's still a lot to refine, I figured now is a good time to share it with the community. I hope you find it interesting! Don't hesitate to reach out, I'm always happy to chat about cool CG stuff.


# At a high level...

Without getting bogged down in too many details (you'll probably get more out of the code itself), here's a broad overview of what's happening:

1) We define a custom primitive type (the "GSplat"), which is basically a cluster of points with some required attributes (orient, opacity, scale and spherical harmonics coefficients). A SOP node creates these simple primitives for the incoming points.
2)  We instruct Houdini about how to render these custom primitives. This is, of course, easier said than done as G-splatting via GPU rasterisation requires a very particular setup (there are plenty of resources online to find out more about what Gaussian Splatting rasterisation entails).
3) The rendering of these primitives needs to be coordinated globally for the viewport (mostly to ensure rendering order). This is achieved via a viewport render hook in this implementation.


# How to install

**Note:** Houdini 20.5+ is a requirement.

This implementation requires compiling source code. For those Houdini users not used to it, this could pose some challenges, please be mindful of this. For convenience I am providing pre-compiled binary files for Windows and MacOS. You can find the files under the `compiled` folder in this repository. It should be just a matter of placing the file that matches your platform (Windows/MacOS/Linux) and Houdini version in the appropriate folder path, as described [here](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/hdk/_h_d_k__intro__creating_plugins.html).

Compiling from source yourself is a bit more involved but not too bad. You can read all about it [here](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/hdk/_h_d_k__intro__compiling.html) and define a workflow that works for you. My approach has been to use Houdini's `hcustom` command. Below the simplest snippet I could come up with that gets the job done, hopefully useful to get you started setting up a workflow that suits your needs.

```
export HOUDINI_VERSION="20.5.278"
cd "/opt/hfs${HOUDINI_VERSION}"
source houdini_setup
cd <PATH_TO_REPOSITORY_BASE>/gsplat_plugin
hcustom -I include -I shaders gsplat_plugin.C
```

# How to use

Once the plugin is picked up by Houdini when it boots up, you should be able use it. In this repository I provide an example hipfile `hip/GSplatPlugin_simpleScene_v001.hipnc` that you can check out to get the idea. I also suggest you setup your viewport in a certain way as shown in the video below:

Please, don't think about the `GSplatSOP` as "the renderer". All that the SOP does under the hood is creating the custom primitive types from the incoming points based on their attributes. From that point on, provided the GSplat primitives exist in a Houdini Geometry that is being displayed (whether they come from one or multiple GSplatSOPs), a global "renderer" takes care of them.

# What's left to do...

Plenty!

I've always taken this project as a playground, and I intend to keep exploring new ideas and refining things in the near future. There are several things I've started playing with that might find their way into the repository soon. Some of these address known issues (see list below), while others involve improvements and new features.

**Current limitations:**
- Expect this to work only on a single viewport
- No Spherical Harmonics rotation currently
- Other 3D elements don't render "in-place" with GSplats

Please keep these limitations in mind, and note that I am not able to commit to a detailed roadmap or specific timeline for addressing them.
